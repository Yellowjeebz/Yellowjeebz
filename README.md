- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Yellowjeebz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science/Cyber Security
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and Haskell, but I'm familiar with Java, Python, C# and Unity. I've also dabbled in logic in Agda.

Take a look at a game I made a couple years ago: https://github.com/Yellowjeebz/Last-One-Standing
